Description: iptables-syslog modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_).
 This package contains the set of loadable kernel modules for
 iptables-syslog.
 .
 The following netfilter extensions are included:
 .
   SYSLOG
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel modules for _KVERS_
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build your
 own iptables-syslog-modules. The iptables-syslog-source package has
 been provided for use with Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package
 utilities to produce a version of iptables-syslog-modules for your
 kernel.
 .
 Note that these modules are not included in the upstream Linux kernel because
 they may be buggy or experimental and should be used with caution.
